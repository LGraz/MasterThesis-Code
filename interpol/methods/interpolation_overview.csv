Savitzky-Golay filter,-- high frequencies are noise (low.pass filter) -- equidistant points,,-- cannot deal natively with missing data (need some interpolation),no,yes,"yes, degree & window",no,no,no,no,yes
+ NDVI,-- upper envelope -- vegetation cannot grow faster than some slope,"-- biological knowledge ","-- bad ""upper envelope"" since weights are not used for the estimation itselfe",(yes - only for stopping),yes,,,,,,
Smoothing Splines,-- 2nd derivative of function is integrable,-- intuitive meaning of penalty -- general assumptions -- flexible shape,-- unbounded,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
B-Splines + Smooth,-- function can be approximated by a linear combination of B-splines basis functions,-- general assumtion -- flexible shape,-- unbounded -- no intuitive meaning for smoothing,,no,no,,"yes, but very high",yes,yes,no
Loess,,,,,,,,,yes,no??,no
Penalized Regression Splines,,,,,,,,,yes,yes,no
gaussian smoothing,,-- simple -- general assumptions,"-- bandwidh: failes if there are big data-gaps ",yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no
Double-Logistic,"-- shape=increas+decrease ","-- good for evergreen plants (if snow masks ndvi) --upper envelope ",-- parameterestimation can go seriously wrong -- strange behaviour for long data-gaps,,,no,no,constant,yes,yes,yes
